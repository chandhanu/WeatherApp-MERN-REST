# WeatherApp-MERN-REST
An MERN Implementation of a Weather App and REST APIs. 

This project is a comprehensive weather application built with ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Redux. It utilizes REST APIs for fetching weather data, Redux for state management, LocalStorage for persisting user preferences, and MongoDB for storing historical weather data.

Features
--------
1. Weather Lookup: Users can search for weather information by zip code.
2. Temperature Metric Selection: Users can choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
3. Historical Data: The application stores and displays historical weather data.
4. LocalStorage Integration: User preferences and recent searches are saved in the browser's LocalStorage.
5. MongoDB Integration: Historical weather data is stored in a MongoDB database.

Technologies Used
-----------------
1. Frontend: ReactJS for building the user interface.
2. Backend: Node.js and Express.js for creating the server and handling API requests.
3. Database: MongoDB for storing historical weather data.
4. State Management: Redux for managing application state.
5. Local Storage: For persisting user preferences and recent searches.
6. APIs: OpenWeather APIs, REST APIs for fetching weather data.

Prerequisites
--------------
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
MongoDB installed and running.

# Implementations
1. Functional Components with Hooks
-----------------------------------
This implementation uses React's functional components and hooks for state management and side effects. It demonstrates the use of useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and lifecycle events.

2. Class Components with Redux, LocalStorage, and MongoDB Integration
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This implementation uses React's class components, Redux for state management, LocalStorage for persisting user preferences, and MongoDB for storing historical weather data. It demonstrates the integration of these technologies in a weather application.
